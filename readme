benefits

- remove fields at any time
- add fields at any time
- rename fields at any time
- since keys are stored as integers,  smaller per document objects.


rules

- Don't change the numeric tags for any existing fields.
- Any new fields that you add should be optional. 
- Non-required fields can be removed, as long as the tag number is not used again
in your updated message type. (it may be better to rename the field instead,
perhaps adding the prefix "OBSOLETE_", so that future users of your .proto can't
accidentally reuse the number)
